CPSC 245-01
Final Project

I did my own work and did not cheat

Source files: MenuManager.cs, background_controller.cs, TrackStats.cs

Scenes: MainMenu

DISCLAIMER::::::::::

I only included the files in this README that are relavent to this classes final which is the main menu system of loading and saving
as well as volume control and level select. However in most of the scripts are lines that update the stats  
like in player_controller line 57.

Known Errors: 

The Sound when you first load in may be muted, some of my friends that play tested said theirs was muted 
when they first loaded in and some said it was pre set to half volume

Credits:

All art and animations was done by me 

All code was done by me

All music was done by "Fantasy & World Music by the Fiechters" found on youtube

All sound effects (shooting sounds, dying sounds, ect) was done by Zero Rare: Sound FX- Retro Pack (no longer on asset store)
